SUMMARY:Seminario: "Designing Sustainable Food Behaviour" â€“ Qian Janice Wang
DTSTART:20250528T080000Z
DTEND:20250528T090000Z
DESCRIPTION:Designing sustainable food behaviour requires more than simply promoting plant-based diets or eco-labels; it demands an integrated understanding of how people conceptualise, perceive, and engage with food. In this talk, I draw on a series of studies conducted at the Department of Food Science, University of Copenhagen, to explore the multiple factorsinfluencing sustainable food choices. These studies draw upon a wide range of research areas, including holistic mental models of meals, sensory and packaging design, and the creation of Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences. The talk concludes by situating these findings within a behavioural change framework and discussing future opportunities for fostering more sustainable food practices.
